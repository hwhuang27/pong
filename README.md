# Pong
Pong made in Lua with the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework.

Difficulty starts out at medium and gradually gets more challenging.

## How to play
Use the `'w'` and `'a'` buttons to move your paddle up and down.

Alternatively, the `'up'` and `'down'` arrow keys also work.

The ball accelerates over time, and the enemy speeds up every time you score.

Try to get at least 10 points!

## Installation

Download `pong.zip` on your computer and extract the `pong-binary` folder.

Run `pong.exe` and play!
