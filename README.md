# Pong
Pong made in Lua with the [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) framework. 
Difficulty starts out at medium and gradually gets more challenging.

## How to play
Use the 'w' and 'a' buttons to move your paddle up and down.
Alternatively, the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys also work.

The ball accelerates over time, and the enemy speeds up every time you score.
Try to get at least 10 points!
